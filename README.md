# LocationEvent
Inputs a pair of coordinates and returns a list of five closest events with cheapest tickets.

## Build and Run Instructions


## Assumptions
- Assume coordinates input has no blank spaces between x and y coordinate input.
- Assume in the case that a few events have the same distance and causes list to exceed 5, events will be picked arbitrarily
- Assume events with no tickets are still displayed
- Assume the distance between neighbouring coordinate in the world is similar.
- Assume max tickets for each event is 20
- Assume each coordinate can hold a maximum of one event
- Assume max price of each ticket is 50 dollars
- Assume probability of each event occurring at any coordinate is 10%.
        
## Testing
Program is tested up to world size of 2000 X 2000

### How might you change your program if you needed to support multiple events at the same location?


### How would you change your program if you were working with a much larger world size?
